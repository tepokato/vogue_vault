# Privacy Policy

Vogue Vault respects your privacy. This policy outlines how the app collects, stores, and uses data.

## Data Collection

The application does not require account creation and collects no personal information. It accesses limited device features only when necessary:

- **Camera** – capture photos for creating or updating looks.
- **Photos/Media/Files (Read Media Images / Read External Storage)** – allow selecting existing images from your device.

No analytics or advertising identifiers are collected.

## Data Usage

Captured or selected images are used solely within the app to manage your wardrobe and appointments. The app does not transmit this content to external servers or share it with third parties.

## Data Storage

All images and related data remain on your device. Removing the app deletes this data. The project does not maintain a remote backend.

## Permissions and Data Safety

Google Play Data safety declarations:

- **Camera** – used to take photos; no data is shared outside the device.
- **Photos/Media/Files** – used to pick images from device storage; data stays local and is not shared.

The app does not collect, sell, or share personal or sensitive user data.
