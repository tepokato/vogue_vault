## Project Architecture

The app follows a feature-driven structure under `lib/`:

- `models/` contains data classes such as `Appointment` and `Client`.
- `services/` holds the service layer. For example, `AppointmentService` uses Hive for local persistence and exposes CRUD operations while notifying listeners via `ChangeNotifier`.
- `screens/` provides the UI widgets for each page.
- `utils/` includes shared helpers and constants.
- `main.dart` wires everything together and registers providers.

Run the full test suite, including unit and widget tests, with:

```bash
